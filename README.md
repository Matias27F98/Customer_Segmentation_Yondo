# Customer_Segmentation_Yondo

As part of Brainnest's Market Research training we were given real customer data from [Yondo](http://yondo.com), a service to host and sell audiovisual content. We are tasked with finding trends that could help us build a Buyer Persona. I chose to leverage a k-means clustering algorithm to inform the qualitative build of the persona with some quantitative rigor! I filtered the data set for customers within the largest segment and built a buyer persona based on their social media presence.
